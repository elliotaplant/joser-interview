# Interview with Joser
Welcome! I'm excited to interview you again

# What do I want to know?
- Can you create novel features with code?
- Is your code clean?
- Can you debug something you haven't seen before?
- How well do you know async code?
- Can you write tests?
- Can you identify security bugs?

# What do we have here?
A ToDo list app with some bugs, some tests, and a feature to add

# What we'll do
1. There is a bug that is preventing us from loading the todos. Can you fix it?
2. Can you write a test to show that it is fixed?
2. Can you make the UI sort by completed/uncompleted todos?
3. Imagine the user has lots of todos. Can you add a pagination feature to the front end and the server?
